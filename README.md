In this project, I developed a Bluetooth-controlled robot car using an HC-05 Bluetooth module and a TM4C123 microcontroller. Our aim was to build upon a previous project by integrating Bluetooth technology to control the car via a smartphone or PC through UART communication. We configured the HC-05 module to receive commands such as direction and speed, enabling the car to move forward, reverse, turn, and adjust speed based on input from a PC terminal or smartphone. Despite some challenges with iOS compatibility, we successfully implemented the Bluetooth communication using a Windows PC. This project enhanced our understanding of Bluetooth technology and its practical applications in modern devices. The comprehensive hardware and software integration was a valuable learning experience, reinforcing concepts like PWM, DC motors, and UART communication. Links to our demo videos and detailed schematics are included in the repository.
